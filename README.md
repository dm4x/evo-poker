ABOUT
=
Solution based on calculating strength of five-card hand.
So my main idea is that texas and omaha both can be calculated in that way
after dividing
(board, hand) tuples of each player (5+2 cards for texas and 5+4 cards for
omaha) to five-card possible hands
and then comparing them like in five card draw.

Unfortunately, texas and omaha are not done yet.
